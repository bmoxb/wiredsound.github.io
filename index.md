Hi, I'm Max - a student at the [University of Bath](https://bath.ac.uk) studying for a BSc in computer science.

Currently, I'm working part-time at [YC S20](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?batch=S20) startup [Shuttle](https://shuttle.rs) building a Rust-first severless platform and a synthetic data generation tool.

This summer, I will be interning at Google in Zurich with a team working on [Borg](https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/)-adjacent tools.

I'm also working on a few personal projects including an [OpenGL-based Rust graphics library](https://github.com/bmoxb/mygl) and a [compiler for a Lisp language](https://github.com/bmoxb/ikou) written in Go.
