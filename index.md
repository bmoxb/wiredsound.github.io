Hi, I'm Max.

I am a student at the <a href="https://bath.ac.uk/">University of Bath</a> studying a BSc in computer science.

Currently, I'm working part-time writing and reviewing <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> code at <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?batch=S20">YC S20</a> synthetic data generation startup <a href="https://www.getsynth.com/">Synth</a>.

I'm also working on a few personal projects including a <a href="https://github.com/WiredSound/goboy">Nintendo GameBoy emulator</a> written in <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>.

下手に 日本語が 話せます。
